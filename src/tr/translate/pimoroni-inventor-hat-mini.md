# Inventor HAT Mini

Inventor HAT Mini is a versatile motor, servo and audio driver HAT for Raspberry Pi. Bring your mechanical inventions, creations and contraptions to life!
â€‹
## Features

- Nuvoton microcontroller (MS51TC0AE) with built-in 16-bit PWM and 12-bit Analog to Digital Converter
  - 4 sets of header pins for connecting 3 pin hobby servos
  - 4 sets of header pins for GPIO (all of which are ADC capable)
  - Servo and GPIO pins all have their own power and ground pins
- Dual H-Bridge motor driver (DRV8833)
  - 2 JST-SH connectors (6 pin) for attaching motors with encoders
  - Alternate socket connector for attaching 2 standard (2 pin) motors
  - Per motor current limiting (425mA)
  - Per motor direction indicator LEDs
- MAX98357 3.2W I2S mono amplifier
  - 2 pin (Picoblade-compatible) connector for attaching speaker
- 8 x addressable RGB LEDs/Neopixels
- User button
- Qw/ST connector for attaching breakouts
- Pass-through 40 pin header
- Fully assembled - no soldering required
